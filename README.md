**How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques**? We can do more than just validate input, and we shouldn't count on input front end input validation.

**How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?** After restoring the code, I re-checked the dependencies and verified that the issues were reduced, and any issues that could be prevented, were prevented.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?** OWASP was a good resouce as well as the dependency check tools

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?** I would showcase the Key generation and implementation to a future employer.
